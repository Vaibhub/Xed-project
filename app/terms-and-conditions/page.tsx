              Please review our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other policies
              available on the Platform (collectively referred to as the
              “Terms”) that govern the use of the Platform and Programs. Each
              Program may have a separate set of terms dealing with refunds,
              deferrals, payments, etc. governing such Programs, and our
              corporate clients may have executed separate written agreements
              with us, which, in the event of a conflict, will supersede these
              Terms to the extent of the conflicting provisions.
            </p>

            <p>
              These Terms shall apply to XED-hosted mobile apps, WhatsApp

              as mentioned above, are provided by third-party service providers,

              not be responsible for any disruption of services caused by such
              third-party service providers.

              Although you may “bookmark” a particular portion of the Platform
              and thereby bypass these Terms, your use of the Platform still
              binds you to these Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              We may change these Terms from time to time without prior notice.
              You should review this page regularly. Your continued use of the
              Platform and Programs after changes have been made will be taken
              to indicate that you have read and accepted those changes. You
              should not use the Platform or Programs if you are not happy with
              any changes to these Terms.

            <p>
              Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by XED, full payment
              for participation in a Program is required at the time of
              registration. It is the sole responsibility of the user enrolling
              in a Program to check the accuracy of, and evaluate the

              towards the services. By using a third-party payment provider, you
              agree to abide by the terms of such a payment provider. You agree
              that in case XED’s third-party payment provider stores any such
              information, XED will not be responsible for such storage, and it
              will be solely at your discretion to allow the third party to
              store such information. Any loss of such information or any loss
              incurred by you due to the usage of such information will be
              solely a loss incurred by you, and XED is in no way liable for any
              such losses and is neither responsible to reimburse/make good such
              losses in any manner whatsoever. You also agree to pay the
